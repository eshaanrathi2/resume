            <h1>Fascination for Olympians and Some Learnings</h1>
            <p>A friend once asked, "What would you be doing if you weren't in tech?" Without missing a beat, I said, "Pro sports!" However, I didn't turn pro; I'm still an ardent sports fan—probably the kind who'd be voted "Most Likely to Know Random Stats." Whether it's a pick-up game, cheering from the sidelines, or glued to my screen watching a match, sports is my jam. I follow stats and records of all major sporting tournaments, including Tennis, Football, Badminton, Martial Arts, Swimming, Athletics, Cricket, and F1 (is that a sport? Debatable for another day xd). If there's a leaderboard, I'm on it.</p>
            <p>Now, if you're like me, you know there's no better time than the Olympics. It's like sports heaven—two weeks of absolute peak human performance. And not just your average athlete doing their thing—these people are out there shattering limits. Watching them gives me an adrenaline rush that no amount of caffeine can match. I've been following the Games live since Beijing 2008 and have watched several recaps of the previous Olympiads. After years of fanboying over these superhumans, I decided to write about what makes Olympians so inspiring.</p>

            <h2>How Hard Is It?</h2>
            <p>To put things into perspective, I dug up some numbers comparing what an average human can do versus what Olympians can pull off in a few sports. Spoiler: it's wild.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The difference is insane. These Olympians perform at levels that seem almost superhuman. Imagine running 100 meters in 9.8 seconds or lifting triple your own body weight. It's no small feat!</p>
            <p>So, I ask again, how hard can it be? What does it take to reach these numbers? As the saying goes, “we can achieve anything with practice.” However, for many Olympic events, there's much more to it. The motto of the Olympics is “Citius-Altius-Fortius,” meaning “Faster, Higher, Stronger.” Certain characteristics that we see in Olympic champions are that they are highly motivated to achieve their goals, laser-focused, work incredibly hard, push themselves to the breaking point, and have the ability to cope with failures.</p>
            <p>Additionally, one must be blessed with the right physique and genetics. External factors like talent identification, nurturing it, and providing resources in a timely manner are crucial as well. All stars have to align to reach those numbers.</p>
            <p>There are examples of Olympians who came from some of the world's most difficult places to live. Some didn't have a country and participated as refugees. It's hard to quantify or realize how difficult it would have been for them to qualify for the Olympics, let alone win medals. I really admire them; their motivation and struggles to reach the Olympics is a story written in golden words.</p>

            <h2>Spotlight</h2>
            <p>A few Olympians at Paris 2024 caught my attention, and I decided to write about them.</p>
            
            <h3>Mijaín López</h3>
            <p>Only Olympian to win gold at 5 Olympics. Sport: Wrestling, Age: 41<br>
            Lopez made history by winning five consecutive gold medals in the same event (Greco-Roman wrestling, 130 kg), a feat unmatched by any other Olympian, including legendary athletes like Michael Phelps. His victories spanned from the 2008 Beijing Olympics to the 2024 Paris Olympics, showcasing his dominance over a remarkable 16-year period.</p>

            <h3>Carolina Marin</h3>
            <p>Olympic Gold medalist, Rio 2016. Sport: Badminton<br>
            In spite of playing well throughout the Olympiad, she unfortunately suffered an injury in Paris 2024 and pulled out. In Tokyo 2020, she was also suffering from an injury. I read her message to the public; she handled it gracefully. I really admire her grit and perseverance.</p>

            <h3>Mondo Duplantis</h3>
            <p>2 Times Olympic champion. Broke his own world record 10 times. Age: 24<br>
            Sport: Pole Vault. The fact that a human can break his own world record 10 times amazes me (and I am sure everyone too). He is the best in the world at what he does, and his only competition is himself.</p>

            <h3>Novak Djokovic</h3>
            <p>2024 Olympics gold. Sport: Tennis<br>
            Djokovic had been trying to win Olympic gold for 16 years across five Olympic Games. His previous best result was a bronze medal at Beijing 2008. With this victory, Djokovic completed the Career Golden Slam, joining an elite group of only five singles players in history to achieve this feat. At 37 years of age, Djokovic became the oldest player to reach and win the men's singles gold medal match. He faced and defeated Carlos Alcaraz, the youngest finalist, who had beaten Djokovic at Wimbledon just weeks earlier. I really admire his endurance, grit, and discipline to keep himself fit at that age.</p>

            <h2>My Takeaways from Olympians</h2>
            <p>I am a software engineer. Like me, most of us may never compete in the Olympics. But the mindset and characteristics of these incredible athletes offer valuable lessons for our everyday lives and careers. Some takeaways which I feel that can be applied to both life and the workplace:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Olympians train tirelessly, committing to a routine that demands focus and hard work every day. The takeaway? Showing up regularly is essential for progress, even when it feels tough.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Not every athlete wins a medal, but they don't let failures stop them. Setbacks happen to everyone, and it's all about getting back up and trying again.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Olympians don't achieve greatness overnight. It takes years of hard work and dedication to reach their goals. The takeaway? Patience and persistence are key; lasting success requires time and effort. Novak would agree xd.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Spirit:</strong> While some sports are individual, others require a strong support system. You can't be an Olympic champion without a coach, mentor, or team.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As I watch the Olympics, I find it's more than just sports; it's a celebration of human potential, endurance, and the pursuit of dreams. These athletes inspire us on overcoming obstacles and pushing limits, whether in sports or in life.</p>
